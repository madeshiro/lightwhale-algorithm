# Lightwhale Algorithm
> Compression and images encoding algorithms: reduce data to rebuild

The LightWhale project is a regroupment of multiples subprojects intended for IoT Wireless communication using LoRa communication system. It is separated into two differents Git:
- The Software/Hardware project, regrouping the custom communication protocol, drivers and hardware description of the home-made network card.
- **The algorithms research git containing a bunch of python scripts and libs for image compression and encoding**

The aim of the LightWhale project is to be able to communicate heavy kind of information (HD images) through the LoRa network using differents tricks like data compression/reduction and full usage of LoRa potential. 
To do so, a custom network card based on differents LoRa chips is currently being designed.
