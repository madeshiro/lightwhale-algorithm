# Notebooks for research and application (R&D)
> This folder contains jupyter notebooks used for custom tests upon the differents
> working-in-progress libraries, and also to help research. 
> 
> Each notebook is sorted according to the targeted library. If a notebook is named after a
> developed python package, it means that it helps to approve, improve results and to document 
> each new milestone reached while doing R&D.
